# OSINT-Project

## Overview
In this project, I'll be taking publicly available data, to find the information through various OSINT tools and techniques Some of the OSINT domains we'll be covering in this project are:

- **Person information**: Where I'll be conducting an investigation on a fraudster's phone number To find names, associated accounts, pictures and uncovering the scammer's entire digital footprint

- **Threat Intelligence** In this domain, I'll be taking advantage of a wide range of open source information to uncover details about high profile threats and threat actors.

<!-- **Company information** -->


But before we get into the crux of the project, I want to briefly discuss what OSINT is and why it's soo important

## What is OSINT
OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) is the process of collecting, gathering, and analyzing information about people, companies and even threats and malicious actors from publicly available sources. OSINT is a very powerful tool for a security operations centers and threat hunting teams.

However OSINT can also be used with malicious intent like doxxing, social engineering attacks and even in the reconnaissance stage for cyber attacks. OSINT relies on a large amount of tools and platforms, some of which we will cover in this project. Some of which include;

- Shodan
- Google dorking
- Sherlock
- The havester 
- Threat view.io
- Threat miner
- AlienVault OTX
